the knowledge base includes:
A project can request R&D relief for a credit with a deduction
    if the project qualifies for research & development relief
    and the SME R&D relief for the project is estimated at the credit with the deduction according to other legislation
        or the project 's R&D expense credit is equal to the credit plus the deduction according to other legislation
. 

A project qualifies for research & development relief 
    if the project looked for an advance in the field
    and the project could not be worked out by a professional in the field
    and the project had to overcome uncertainty
    and the project tried to overcome uncertainty by a solution.

A project could not be worked out by a professional in the field 
    if the project's previous attempts have failed.

A project could not be worked out by a professional in the field 
    if the project has its members in a list
    and a member is in the list
    and the member explained uncertainties as a reason.
 
A project had to overcome uncertainty 
    if the project has an experts list 
    and an expert is in the experts list
    and the project could not be explained by the expert.
