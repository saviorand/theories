the target language is: prolog. 

the templates are:
    *A vehicle* is permitted to enter *a junction* at *a time*. 
    *A vehicle* have watched *a junction* until *a time*. 
    there are users crossing *a junction* at *a time*.
    there is a safe gap between *a vehicle* and any user approaching *a junction* at *a time*.
    *a vehicle* have watched *a junction* before *a time*.
    *a user* has no visual of *a vehicle* at *a time*.
    *a user* of *a type* is approaching *a junction* from *a position* at *a time*.     	
    there is a safe gap between *a user* and *a vehicle* and *a junction* at *a time*.
    *a user* will reach *a junction* at *a time*.
    *a vehicle* will cross *a junction* at *a time*. 
    *a time* is clearly before *a second time* plus some security margin.

the knowledge base rule170 includes:

a vehicle is permitted to enter a junction at a time 
    if the vehicle have watched the junction before the time
    and it is not the case that
    	there are users crossing the junction at the time
    and there is a safe gap between the vehicle and any user approaching the junction at the time. 

there is a safe gap between a vehicle and any user approaching a junction at a time if
    for all cases in which
        a user of a type is approaching the junction from a position at the time
    it is the case that
    	there is a safe gap between the user and the vehicle and the junction at the time. 

scenario one is:
    av1 have watched junction01 before 2.
    there is a safe gap between av1 and any user approaching junction01 at 2. 

query one is:
    which vehicle is permitted to enter which junction at which time. 

% watch out for cyclists, motorcyclists and pedestrians including 
% powered wheelchairs/mobility scooter users as they are not always easy to see. 
% Be aware that they may not have seen or heard you if you are approaching from behind  
scenario b1 is:
    user1 will reach j1 at 4.
    v1 will cross j1 at 2.
    0 is clearly before 2 plus some security margin.
    there is a safe gap between a user and a vehicle and a junction at a time T if 
        and the user will reach the junction at a time T1
        and the vehicle will cross the junction at a time T2
        and T2 is clearly before T1 plus some security margin 
        and T is before T1.
