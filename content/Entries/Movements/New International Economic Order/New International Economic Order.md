In (Сites::[[The New International Economic Order A Reintroduction]] ):

 >Focusing on different dimensions of the NIEO, our authors variously suggest that the NIEO was:
> - a bid to empower the United Nations General Assembly as the legislative body for making binding international law
> -   a critique of legal formalism
> 	-> [creates::[[NIEO Legal Formalism Critique]]] (that targets legal formalism)
> -   the genealogical starting point for “the right to development”
> 	-> [creates::[[Right to development]]]
> -  an effort to create a global regulatory framework for transnational corporations
> 	-> [creates::[[NIEO Regulatory Framework]]] (that regulates transnational corporations)
> -  an extension of the principle of sovereignty from the political to the economic realm
> 	-> [contributesTo::[[Economic Sovereignty]]]
> 	-> [uses::[[Political Sovereignty]]]
> -   an incrementalist approach to reforming global economic and political power arrangements
> -   an endeavor to redress historical grievances of newly independent states, thereby “completing” decolonization
> -   a call for global redistribution—including financial, resource, and technology transfer—from rich to poor countries
> -  an attempt to universalize and globalize the principles of “embedded liberalism” 
> -   the high noon of “Third Worldism” and its vision of solidarity among the poorer nations
> -  a radical challenge to the historic hegemony of the North Atlantic industrial core
> -  a realistic program for global socialism
> -   a utopian political project, global and totalizing in its ambitions
> -  an alternative model for transnational economic integration—that is, of globalization
> -  a key catalyst (via backlash) for the formulation of the neoliberal paradigm in favor of limiting state power and augmenting private power
