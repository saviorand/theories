 >Focusing on different dimensions of the NIEO, our authors variously suggest that the NIEO was:
> - a bid to empower the United Nations General Assembly as the legislative body for making binding international law
> 	-> [does::[[NIEO Empowering UN General Assembly]]]
> -   a critique of legal formalism
> 	-> [creates::[[NIEO Legal Formalism Critique]]] (that targets legal formalism)
> -   the genealogical starting point for “the right to development”
> 	-> [creates::[[Right to development]]]
> -  an effort to create a global regulatory framework for transnational corporations
> 	-> [creates::[[NIEO Regulatory Framework]]] (that regulates transnational corporations)
> -  an extension of the principle of sovereignty from the political to the economic realm
> 	-> [contributes::[[Economic Sovereignty]]]
> 	-> [uses::[[Political Sovereignty]]]
> -   an incrementalist approach to reforming global economic and political power arrangements
> 	-> [creates::[[NIEO Global Institutional Reform]]]
> -   an endeavor to redress historical grievances of newly independent states, thereby “completing” decolonization
> 	-> [contributes::[[Decolonization]]] 
> -   a call for global redistribution—including financial, resource, and technology transfer—from rich to poor countries
> 	-> [contributes::[[International technology transfer]]]
> -  an attempt to universalize and globalize the principles of “embedded liberalism” 
> -   the high noon of “Third Worldism” and its vision of solidarity among the poorer nations
> 	-> [contributes::[[Thirld-Worldism]]]
> -  a radical challenge to the historic hegemony of the North Atlantic industrial core
> 	-> [challenges::[[North Atlantic hegemony]]]
> -  a realistic program for global socialism
> 	-> [creates::[[NIEO Global Socialism Model]]]
> -   a utopian political project, global and totalizing in its ambitions
> -  an alternative model for transnational economic integration—that is, of globalization
> 	-> [creates::[[NIEO Alternative Globalization Model]]]
> -  a key catalyst (via backlash) for the formulation of the neoliberal paradigm in favor of limiting state power and augmenting private power
> 	-> [provokes::[[Neoliberalism]]] 

>In particular, the NIEO Declaration called for: 
>	-> [creates::[[NIEO Declaration]]]
>(a) an absolute right of states to control the extraction and marketing of their domestic natural resources; 
>(b) the establishment and recognition of state-managed resource cartels to stabilize (and raise) commodity prices; 
>(c) the regulation of transnational corporations; 
>(d) no-strings-attached technology transfers from north to south; 
>(e) the granting of preferential (nonreciprocal) trade preferences to countries in the south; and 
>(f) the forgiveness of certain debts that states in the south owed to the north. Together, all these proposals amounted to an assertion of the “economic sovereignty” of postcolonial states.
